# DeepFake Detection Model Prediction

This repository contains a Python script for predicting deepfake videos using a pre-trained model on a GPU environment. The script uses advanced techniques including face recognition and deep learning models to perform the analysis.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the script, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- `numpy`
- `cv2` (OpenCV)
- `matplotlib`
- `torch`
- `torchvision`
- `face_recognition`

This code is intended to be run on a Google Colab environment with GPU support enabled. Ensure that your environment is correctly set up before proceeding.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or Google Colab environment:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git

2. pip install numpy opencv-python matplotlib torch torchvision face_recognition

## Usage: 
To run the script, simply execute the DFD_Model_Predict.ipynb notebook. Make sure to mount your Google Drive if you are using Google Colab:
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
